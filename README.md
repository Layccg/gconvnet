G-CNN layer implementation for Tensorflow/Keras. Based on [Group Equivariant Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07576).


## Representation of groups

A group is represented by a class. An element of the group is represented by an object of that class. At a minimum a group G should implement:

* `G()` should construct the identity element.

* `G.__mul__` does group composition.

* `G.inverse` computes the inverse group element and returns it.

* `G.__eq__` should test for equality of group elements.

* `G.name` String name of the group. Set to None if no name is provided.

Additionally groups should if possible implement the following:

* `G.__str__` string representation of the group element.

For a group G acting on a convolutional layer we will additionally require:

* `G` is a finite group.

* `G.size` Integer representing the number of elements in the group.

* `G.__int__` Returns an integer representation of the group element. This should
  provide a bijection between the group elements and the integers `0,1,...,G.size-1`.

* If integer representation is passed to `G.__init__` it should construct the corresponding
  group element. In particular we should have `int(G(k)) == k` for k in `0,1,...,G.size-1`.

For lightweight groups consider using the utility functions:

* `create_indexed_group_class` for finite groups with integer representations.

* `create_group_class` for infinite groups.


### Sub- and quotient groups

Currently subgroups and quotientgroups are only implemented for finite groups with integer
representation.

A subgroup of G is a group H for which we have the following:

* H is a subgroup of G in the group theoretic sense.

* `H.G_to_H` is a `G.size` sized integer array translating G integer representations
  to H integer representations. Any G integer representation that does not
  correspond to an element of H should map to -1.

* `H.H_to_G` is an `H.size` sized integer array translating H integer representations
  to G integer representations.

* `H.supergroup` should be G

Note: What we call a subgroup might more correctly be called a subgroup inclusion. The distinction serves as a distraction for end-users so we stick to calling it a subgroup even though technically it is slightly more. 

A quotient group `G/H` is a group GmodH for which we have the following:

* `GmodH.supergroup` is a group G

* `GmodH.subgroup` is H, a normal subgroup of G (warning: it is up to the user to check
  that H is a normal subgroup. If H is not a normal subgroup of G no guarantees are
  provided regarding behavior.

* `GmodH.G_to_GmodH` is a `G.size` sized integer array translating G integer representations
  to H integer representations.

* `GmodH.GmodH_to_G` is a `(G.size/H.size)` sized integer array translating coset indices to
  a G index of some group element of G in the coset. Users should not depend on any particular
  rule regarding which element of the coset is chosen as the representative.
